The story has come to the beginning
Wayne.

[Verse 1: Shawn Wayne]
Yes, Shawn Wayne. 
A lot of stupid questions, I'm sitting in front of the baby.
Black guys don't come in, we're not part of the family.
Chip has already received his toys. 
It's in my interest to make money, not to touch the ground with the guys.
It's been over a year since I promised my family, and now I've definitely found my Marina.
She is very kind to me, we had a good beer together.
A formal suit, this is the first time I've touched it. 
I usually prefer tracksuits, but right now it's about money.
My sister got all the knowledge she was given
Now we need to move on, forget it.
Mother has shed enough tears, it's time to make her happy (make her happy)
And a nigger can only argue with friends
I hope Whitney turns our family into hippies.
Am I on the fifth, seventh, tenth day now? at the studio. 
I'm living this shit.
It's not about the fucking S-D-M.
The horn sounded, it says M&M.
My beloved brother, you can wait. 
Chip and I are working comrades now. Now we are happy, we have been accepted into the family. 
But after two hours of drinking, death calls me...">

              data-lyrics="[Verse 1]
At what point did I enter the wrong room?
It's like, like a scythe in my hands.
I'm walking down the corridor, it's too narrow here.
Money is nothing more than a thing, but it helps to survive.
Now I'm looking for salvation in myself, but the assistant is only a God.
I'm standing alone and I don't forget to use my tongue.
Surrounded by love, but I feel lonely.

[Chorus - MurdaL]
Money in the ghetto, we hustle through the night,
Chasing down our dreams, till we make it to the light.

[Verse 2 - Shawn Wayne]
Thanks for helping with this, nigga. None of the Waynes would be broadcasting right now.
I don't want my sister to change her residence permit
Because of his younger brother's stupidity
Thank you Mom, you gave me everything I needed. 
It's time to thank you and come back pumped.
The road was divided into two descents, you can distract yourself and take care of yourself
But the stupid boy chose the second goal, now he will have to spend a health bar
I've been here all day, I didn't need a call. 
The boss is going to go to the airport, something is waiting for us. What?
A rude conversation was heard, the ancestors obviously would not be happy to learn that I was picked up by the Japanese Mafia.
It was easy to get the money, anyone who entered the base would be naked.
The work takes place on the street, it will be impossible to see how the girls undressed.
Based on my thoughts, Mom is now helping her sister. 
The fact is that you have to treat niggers.
My brother likes to inhale cigarette smoke.
Maybe something stronger, but we're at work.
I'll be realistic. Thinking is narrow, you have to ask again. I have zero skills, but I have to help.

[Verse 3 - MurdaL]
In the shadows of the streets, where the hustle never sleeps,
Every day we grind, chasing dollars and our dreams.
Born into the struggle, but we rise above the trouble,
Counting every penny, making paper by the double.
Survival of the fittest, in the land of the gritty,
Where the strong survive, and the weak get no pity.
From the corner stores to the alleyways we roam,
Making something out of nothing, this is how we make a home.

[Chorus - MurdaL]
Money in the ghetto, we hustle through the night,
Chasing down our dreams, till we make it to the light.

[Verse 4 - Shawn Wayne]
The whores have been left behind, several cars are rushing.
I've outgrown this shit, but to slacken now is to be a pussy.
An easy photo shoot, everyone got their own pen.
The niggas on the other hand have already appeared, they look like fans.
Shot after shot, women screaming. I don't understand their language and fuck it.
The nigga died on the spot, my brother threw me in the car, it's time to get back.
The work continues, everyone has forgotten about what happened.
And if winning means someone's death, I'd rather lose, Lord.
But when you threaten me and my family, you have to implored.
But when you threaten me and my family, you have to implored.">

Is there anything you want to share?

[Verse 1: Shawn Wayne]
I want to tell you to fuck off.
My mother won't find out, I went to the bros. 
There's a problem with me, the rider on the horse.
My head is on fire, I have doubts, 
but when I see a bunch of confident faces, I want to roll the dice.
The nigga doesn't know yet that his store is serviced by a cleaning service.
Harsh realities, nine hundred and ninety-two.
Nerves cause aggression, ay ay ay
A big deal requires patience, ay ay ay
But I remained bald, now my tongue feels salt.
Tomorrow I will help my sister, she doesn't know anything, she's not in the game.
At the time, it all seemed like a game with a happy ending.
The euphoria came and made San Andreas skate.

[Chorus: Shawn Wayne]
The same feels, same feels, same feels and city miss.
We don't need to get high wheels to get euphoria feels.

[Verse 2: Shawn Wayne]
Mouse didn't appreciate it, I tried so hard, but he was exhausted.
The diss caused the same feelings.
I'll say the same about my sister. She has succeeded, and I will help her with this.
Got something to say, my nigga? I know it's not. 
You've been very busy promoting cloud, these feelings are back.
King Sean Wayne - repeat those words. 
Black remains black, even after years. 
My connections won't go anywhere, but I'm retired now.
May ears? May tits 
All I son is to throw away the phone. After all, no one will jerk off anymore, leaving a shot
Modesty, poverty, your environment - all this will bring up a good person, tight belt
It's not for me to judge, I was raised according to Stanley's laws. 
But as you get older, you realize
San Andreas makes euphoria, it's better than spice

[Chorus: Shawn Wayne]
The same feels, same feels, same feels and city miss.
We don't need to get high wheels to get euphoria feels.">

IDLEWOOD KID, WHAT ARE YOU TURNING INTO?

[Verse 1 - Shawn Wayne]
Started from the bottom, where the sun rarely shines,
Battling the darkness, with his rhythm and his rhymes.
On the block with his homies, spitting fire every day,
Nigga signed his first deal, but the grind didn't stop,
In the studio late nights, aiming for the top.
First shit dropped, the hood showed love,
From the streets to the charts, he fit like a glove.
Now he’s on top, but he stays humble and true

[Chorus - inferno]
Crown on the head
Crown on the head
Nigga was crowned
Crown on the head, bitch

[Verse 2 - inferno]
Just a kid from the block with a mic in my hand,
Dreaming of the stage, trying to make a stand.
Writing rhymes in my room, late nights on the grind,
Every beat, every line, reflecting what's on my mind.
Watching the legends, hoping one day I'll be next,
Spitting fire at the cyphers, giving everything, no less.
Recording in the basement, with a makeshift booth,
Every track a step closer to uncovering my truth.

[Chorus - inferno]
Crown on the head
Crown on the head
Nigga was crowned
Crown on the head

[Verse 3 - Shawn Wayne]
Eyes on the prize, though the journey's just begun,
Gotta stay focused, keep my vision on the run.
From the ghetto to the stars, I know it's a climb,
But I'm ready for the hustle, ready to shine.
No one will feel sorry for me, all niddas play villains.
It feels like only my eyes are not lying.
You died a brave death, little frog.
I'm going to dance on this grave of creeps walk.
One, two, three, four, five - A hot ten will suck me.
A couple of racists will get bang.

[Chorus - inferno]
Crown on the head
Crown on the head
Nigga was crowned
Crown on the head">

- Why did you come all this way, Shawn? What is the moral?
- I do not know, mister. All I want is to express myself.

[Verse 1]
Still, he kept silent about what happened after the shooting.
Only four letters fit into the remington, the fourth letter.
It meant a lot to me, it matters.
Chip was driving and Marina was directing him. 
A boss and a wonderful girl, I've been in love with her since the very beginning of my job.
Her brother Joe and I were in the shadows. He got off lightly, but we were proud of him, he knows.
The rush of adrenaline, I felt bad. Marina refused the request to turn to the bar.
Now the Rem was rolling towards Blue-bar-ry.
The trunk was full of beer bottles. I'm not a drinker, but the situation is fascinating.
The moon helps to avoid an accident, Los Santos is too long, we hardly left it.
The steering wheel in the nigger's hands slid like soap.
The road has become sloped
Turning onto the beach, the car was left alone. Joe unfolded the tents and offered to jump into the water.
I sat on the sidelines and watched Marina
She didn't undress, but I was definitely something seen a.
The nigga was drinking alcohol, after throwing out a few words about Chappie, he walked away.
My gun was still in my pocket, I threw it to hell anyway.
It's the middle of the night, only the stars are visible. 
Marina noticed a triangle in the sky, this is a constellation. With that, she began a dialogue.
Her charming appearance caught my eye
Again
Her charming appearance caught my eye
She collapsed next to me, her words were so hypnotic.
Joe was already asleep, the chip was missing. Hope it.
I hope this is what I think, Marina slowly crawled down. 
Her sweet lips made me sob with pleasure.
I was experiencing high blood pressure.
That night was my first adult experience, little Shawn fell head over heels in love with Marina.

[Verse 2]
The eldest woke me up before the others.
Now we need to lay low, our people are unlikely to be happy about contacts with Asians.
Tears welled up in my eyes, this is the last meeting with her.
Chip said it's not the North Shore, it's the West Coast.
I won't feel like a unit anymore.
I won't feel alive.
My only love is in the past, now we're on the run.
Home, Idlewood Street. Our ancestors greeted us with stories about the state in Nigeria.
Just for fun. 
Who knows how long Wayne Jr. would have had to live if Chip hadn't picked him up that night.
The Mafia could have eradicated the source of Rap, but eventually heard the designation of the ultimate difference. But I'm estranged.
The parameter has changed.">

[Intro: Shawn Wayne]
I don't know what I'll tell you next time, maybe it won't be.
Twenty-seven plus sixty-three, you should look into prayer.
A lot of shit, harm and shame - all that comes from w.
I know niggas like to be bad, but why are you bad in San Fierro?
This message has been preparing for eight thousand days, many will get bored now.
About The Fate That Was Known part one, I stop this stream of thoughts.
I'm sorry, I'm not tired of apologizing. I've finally done and I'll keep working on it.
Throughout my speech, you have observed the story of Siddhartha.
Now it's time to put everything in its place and drop the burden of doubta.

[Bridge]
Oh, Shawn Wayne. How many times have I told myself that I will never leave the comfort zone?
My angels would never recognize me now.
It wasn't an apple that fell on my head so that I would understand what a gangster is.
Soon I got a feeling like Julius, I'm doing so many things now.

[Verse 1: Shawn Wayne]
Alcohol, whores, fights and shooting. Now it's nothing but shame, an vow.
I swear that all this is behind me, there are two letters s left behind me, and my crowd.
You've already heard all the names, Fernand was a good man, I can't say a bad thing.
Niggas have started a whole war, a ring lover doesn't like hookahs.
Something that cannot be understood after hearing, books has.
I had to see one Brutus, didn't I already mention Julius?
The conflict between the Offroad and the Smile has faded away, I was not impressed.
Hip-hop needs a boost and definitely not in the form of a diss on Poirier.
What am I writing about? This is a whole epic about Internet lovers.
Each step must be analyzed and benefits extracted.
Are you listening to this movement stuff?
Nigger, it's the whole universe to me. I don't think there is a person on staff who works on texts at night caption.
But this is a legacy issue. When you want to defeat it, you will have to change the population.
I'm not rich, B-Wayne is ahead and that's no reason to be jealous.
I am driven by love for my family and recognition, no one will charge me a percentage.
I will be humiliated only in front of the creator, but until then I will exalt myself.
By self rated my last album as shit, removing it from the sites.
High I conclude this divine essay with a big one.

[Verse 2: Shawn Wayne]
Let's not go into details, everyone will understand what happened anyway. 
It was nine, there was one left, on the way.
A lot of time has passed since then, survivor's mistake. It's a familiar feeling. I was inspired by the morality of pglang.
But I have accepted my fate and I will set a good example.
Only God can humiliate me, until then I exalt myself. Counterexample
Why are they so angry, where is their punishment? I sent the money and would like to help young infant.
The past work remained in the shadows, joy and freedom in the soul.
It was time to turn over all the cards, it was a big foul.
The platforms will not be seen, people will not hear. Deleted due to bad feelings.
San Andreas, Idlewood, Los Santos. The message has come to an end, I am proud of it.
I am proud of it.

Enough time has passed.
You can open your mouth.
A new flow, a transition to a different sound.
Take out the pen, open the notebook
Start writing the album, it will take a long time, but be sure that it will bring good songs.

[Verse 1]
You're going to Jazz Rap - it's something stupid, isn't it?
I'd rather you listen to my speeches than dance to me in clubs.
Pop lovers - I recommend going back to listening to Drakes, dump this shit.
I've got a lot of thoughts in my head, and now it looks like I need to let them go.
As you can see, I'm low.
And even in this state, I will choose a bottle of water, but not a Patrón.

My name may not say anything, but when the bitch moves her ass
She'll have to shout it out.
My shares are rising gradually
A new style and sound, that's what we're aiming for. (Really)
I'm home now, Degster's with me. The show doesn't end, we're only in the second act, come on. (Come)
Feelings are mixed, this is another visit. 
My pen is a dagger, and KwaBo is a victim.

Steak and delicious coffee, I know a lot about my brothers.

The distance was too great when I found out about his problems.
Problems can be solved, but not when you are closed in yourself
Nigga, take my help.
So much friendship time, a lot of sound and money. 
Problems come, then go away. You just need to share it.
I didn't keep up, and you closed up.
The music world has lost a great artist, a great man.

Time, goals, friendship, death. This album has already said a lot
Let's move on to the next lesson.
It's enough to know what it's like to be born
To be born without problems for yourself, but almost kill your mother without getting her kiss.
I'm not complaining, we don't choose this. Thank you, God, thank you for making me who I am.
Childhood is very difficult, there is very little money, and I prove it only with my mentality.
It is not necessary to return to the topic of problems, I have voiced them and am moving on.
My hood is secured, this is what pleases me further on.

My soul whispers about it, who am I not to meet her?
Each soul is equal, but its weight is estimated by scales.
I don't remember his name, he changed after he got subscribers.
If Tang is going to kill Kai for this, then he shouldn't get his hands dirty.
Idiots call Santos criminogenic
It's not like that, niggas are just trying to get a good life.
In an mad city from the government
The younger generation will move us on.
I want to use my powers smarter
To guide them, without feeling racist.

Something tells me that we are on the right track.
This path is very long and difficult, it is better for us not to injure the neck.
It's not worth looking back.
My house is at the end of the tunnel, my eyesight is failing and this is a hindrance.
Niggas accompany me, I know and remember everyone. 
Thanks, brothers, we're moving on.
Models, businessmen. They came from Fierro to Santos. 
Their plans included creating a fest on the beach, but this is not their home.

You're funny, but that's not enough to gain any weight.
I'm not a thug, much less a gangster. My friends are in this shit.
And I respect them, really.
I'll be the first
Even alone, I will continue to climb up the world.
Home is a broad concept, I put meaning into this word.

Kamala is his bitch, she's smartest.

Trump was already president, he didn't change much. 
If the old man's smarter, then I'm glad of it, nigga.
But for now, Ye for president, nigga.

To destroy. It is easy to forgive and to forget

Indifference is hard to obtain
Because you constantly have to remind yourself 
Of what happens
When you allow your emotions to rule over your judgment
With indifference
You have to learn to come to knowledge 
To swift through that knowledge
To extract understanding
To dive deep into that knowledge
And extract the nugget of wisdom

Ask you to turn around and leave common sense behind
It won't be hard to come back, but find out the reason for leaving
Give a sense of trust, man is a creature of God, he is endowed with feeling
Again racism, again we are inferior, again criminals
Fuck this TV, turn this TV off, these motherfuckers are so typical.
I don't like playing games, I want to keep my psyche intact. We will make money and leave, the main thing is to remember our ancestors and color type.
I only feel alive on the street, my nigas are like brothers to me and the street is a parent.
The sinner will take a weapon in his hand, point it at the creature
But you have to know the line and fuck with good people, all around is nature.
All this leads your life's journey, drawing a boundary beyond the border

[Verse 1]
Шестнадцать, красивая цифра. Подросток с Ай-Пиццы, ответственность ложится
Каждый год как старый, мать всё ещё боится, надеюсь оправдать ожидания, сменить обстановку, замкнуть непорочный круг.
Эмоциональный гангстер, не люблю это слово, но что происходит вокруг?
Я слишком мало вижу, молодой, мысли убиты туманом. Позовут на блоки, пойду и устрою продажи, оставят за дверью? Оставлю под небом своё отражение.
Опасность повсюду - это не белый район Сан-Фиерро. Здесь пули летают чаще, чем летящие Божьи творения.
А что до этого мелкого, живёт свою жизнь, не любит проёбы, помощь семье и работа блохой, мамины слёзы, ярость и кровь, папа неделями прячется, повод расслабиться и отдохнуть, женщине нужна лишь опора, для этого и существую я тут.

'Что ты здесь делаешь, сука? Мелкий, свали от машины.
Твое место в тюрьме, черный пиздюк, еще шаг и выстрел!'
Мама ждет дома, я несу торт, шагаю с учебы
Район перекрыли, сват, уебки без разбору вязали ниггеров. Крузак у подъезда, пытаюсь пройти, но безликий наглеет, тычет оружием. 
Как попасть мне домой - никого не ебет.
Связан ли я с наркотой - никто не разберет.
Есть ли причины брать черного пиздюка - кто не найдет?
Я тут один, обхожу машину, удар по затылку, очнулся на пассажирском.
'Тебе сказали дважды, вали отсюда нахуй!'...
Из машины не выбраться, я тут один, кисти убиты, миля за милей, куда-то летим. Оковы из стали, решетка и взгляды, черный в Америке, а как же иначе?

[Verse 1]
Женское внимание - то что нужно всем мужчинам
Если ты упустишь малыша, последствия необратимы
Сегодня день рождения у моего сына, я жду его с учебы, хотя идти туда его я не просила.
Жизнь полна сюрпризов, черные всегда жили под миром, пропаганда белых мужиков заставляет думать что мы дышим красиво. 
Проблемы угнетенных не только черных дам, любой мужчина может получить оттуда, откуда не ожидал
Опора и поддержка для любящей жены, но муж оказался трусом, пьяный урод, такие черные причина вражды и мусор.
Работаю три раза в день, пример любви к ребенку. Готова пойти на все, достать красивую путевку. 

[Chorus]
Скажи что дашь мне быть твоей путевкой в лучшую жизнь.
Ты можешь быть моей опорой, посмотрим мы на звезды
Увидим те пейзажи, что дарит нам надежда.
Увидимся в прекрасном, я буду благодарна.
Я буду благодарна...

[Verse 2]
Я буду благодарна за всю твою любовь, верну её в двойне, искуплю факториал моих грехов.
Сирены потянули за уши, 'выгляни в окно!'. На улице под солнцем зеленые береты, логотип из задницы, перепутать невозможно. 
Звонок, второй, третий, трубку не берет. Паника охватывает, материнские инстинкты отключают мозг
Слезы, страх, вновь как сирота, звонок помог мне протрезветь, сына ждёт тюрьма.
Никто не может отобрать у матери ребенка, я в ожидании суда, но проводить его не будут, поймали черного, 'раба'.
Женское внимание - то что нужно всем мужчинам
Если ты упустишь малыша, последствия необратимы
Сегодня день рождения у моего сына, я ждала его с учебы, но у жизни другие планы, я поняла какие. Встреча через год, встреча матери и сына.

[Chorus]
Скажи что дашь мне быть твоей путевкой в лучшую жизнь.
Ты можешь быть моей опорой, посмотрим мы на звезды
Увидим те пейзажи, что дарит нам надежда.
Увидимся в прекрасном, я буду благодарна.
Я очень благодарен...
Дай мне своё доверие...
Искупить мои грехи...
Я очень благодарен...">

Age only multiplies when you get older my nigg
Become a man and make yourself a friend 
You never know what's gonna happen
If you don't take a chance and talk to yourself.

[Chorus]
Look at me and see what's wrong, dawg.
It's up to you to grow up and then give the fruit that needs to be growd (growd).
I don't give a fuck about the problems of the outside world (world).
The most important thing now is to raise the child (child).

[Verse 2]
It's not just a baby that can bring out the man in you.
Try to unwind and send your opinion out for a walk
There's a lot of interesting things around here, nature doesn't end at the c-walk.
Gotta evolve and look for new heights, nigga.
I took Rollin' and Ritter, the U.S. tour blew us away, nigga.
Dupri gave a good live in one of the states
Respect to the nigger, he wasn't afraid to start fighting with bro, we are mates.
The strength of the lion, I don't like to brag about accomplishments. 
But you should see my cars, that's what your own opinion is worth.

[Chorus]
Look at me and see what's wrong, dawg.
It's up to you to grow up and then give the fruit that needs to be growd (growd).
I don't give a fuck about the problems of the outside world (world).
The most important thing now is to raise the child (child).

[Verse 3]
I'd like to get out and walk through City Hall.
White bitches in uniform like to wreak havoc.
There's no racism here homie, these are dry facts
I'd rather have white friends than black Nazis dawgs.
Rodeo Park was destroyed by the power of the our people
Los Santos police just killed a man
We don't like it, that's our opinion.
Republicans want to shift power to themselves
Dirty freaks in ties are spreading dirty fakes.
We just need to remember that we are a strong nation
Grow yourself, then your opinion, your opinion as your child.">

Everybody stop talking now, attention.
I told yall, all of my critics. 
I told you all that i was a greatest of all time. When i beat Suny Liston
I told you today im still the greatest of all time. Never again defeat me.
Never again say that im going to be defeated, 
never again make me the underdog untill im about 50 years old.">

The steps were hard and the road was long
Niggers fake it, Opposite this song. (x8)

[Verse 1]
An iconic trio, I recall many characters at once
Franklin michael trevor, that's from gta 5.
Caesar, Crassus, Pompey - the first triumvirate
Duck tales are for kids.
The Three Musketeers comme un souvenir, aussi.
Right now I'm feeling like that with Smiley, who will be the third?
We talked about the plunge, the long road
Greatness was replaced by stupidity, silence gave birth to wealth
Nigga life journey became the key to his sins.
Stigma of being an educator is what made me indifferent
Yeah, I'm like Ali. Freed from the slave name and took off, now I'm...
Number one, number two and number three.
Indifference is the mark of a man, and I'm number one here
I don't care what anyone says on the side, I came to this on my own.
Shawn Wayne new book took a long time to load. 
But now, now I am worthy to be called the GOAT.

[Chorus]
The steps were hard and the road was long
Niggers fake it, Opposite this song.">

Mmm
Eee
Haha
Sean Wayne is back with a new verse
My name may not say anything, but when the bitch moves her ass
She'll have to shout it out.
My shares are rising gradually
A new style and sound, that's what we're aiming for. (Really)
I'm home now, Degster's with me. The show doesn't end, we're only in the second act, come on. (Come)
Feelings are mixed, this is another visit. 
My pen is a dagger, and KwaBo is a victim.
What do you think of him, nigga? (Haha)

[Chorus - dumpboii]
Weak and pathetic, he did not set a goal for himself.
Rap is not fun, you should not feel sorry for yourself.
Sit down, listen, everything will be fine.
You just have to start your own line.

[Verse 2 - dumpboii]
There is something nearby that cannot be named.
I'm ready to get the trumps and send you to fame.
You should be a good girl.
Get down carefully and do your job (Blow?)
Shut your mouth and listen to those who occupy the highest places
It's funny to look at your stupid faces.

[Verse 2 - Shawn Wayne]
Today's goal is to take away your ears.
To attract attention and give you a break.
Tomorrow I will try to bring you to the meaning of the song.
If it doesn't work out, then knock the fuck out of Shawn, you little donk.

[Chorus - dumpboii]
Weak and pathetic, he did not set a goal for himself.
Rap is not fun, you should not feel sorry for yourself.
Sit down, listen, everything will be fine.
You just have to start your own line.">

I'm loved, I'm hated, it's 50-50. They tried to hurt me many times, but I'm still the same nigger.
I try to keep it clean, but what's the point?
I can't save myself if I don't realize where I'm wrong. 
If I fall on my knees, get up and realize I'm evolving.
I can't save myself if I don't know where I'm going wrong. 
If I fall on my knees, I'll get up and realize I'm evolving.

[Verse 1 - inferno, Shawn Wayne, Lorraine Adams]
Fucking bullshit about success and invincibility, it's all about playing to cover the truth.
Save yourself, only you can do it.
Call your loved ones for help, but make sure they're not rats.
There's a lot of talentless people out there, they're saints.
But when it comes down to it, they're empty inside.
We're made of a different breed, we're not easy to kill, even in the worst weather.
Everybody's got a flaw, but you gotta keep an open mind, get rid of it, make it right.

[Chorus - Shawn Wayne, Lorraine Adams]
I'm loved, I'm hated, it's 50-50. They tried to hurt me many times, but I'm still the same nigger.
I try to keep it clean, but what's the point?
I can't save myself if I don't realize where I'm wrong. 
If I fall on my knees, get up and realize I'm evolving.
I can't save myself if I don't know where I'm going wrong. 
If I fall on my knees, I'll get up and realize I'm evolving.

[Verse 2 - Yung Rollin, Shawn Wayne]
Piles of joints, lots of behinds, I left it behind.
There's no shortage of reasons, try to take it out of context.
There's a reason for their pretenses, they're just jealous of us
There's no way around it, we're the leaders.
The key is around our necks, look into our souls.
Anyone can open the door, but not everyone will understand.
I'm armed and protected, I've been building it for years.
But everyone's got flaws, once opened, live the truth.

[Chorus - Shawn Wayne, Lorraine Adams]
I'm loved, I'm hated, it's 50-50. They tried to hurt me many times, but I'm still the same nigger.
I try to keep it clean, but what's the point?
I can't save myself if I don't realize where I'm wrong. 
If I fall on my knees, get up and realize I'm evolving.
I can't save myself if I don't know where I'm going wrong. 
If I fall on my knees, I'll get up and realize I'm evolving.">
